bio:

After two years of studying industrial design at the Henry Van de Velde Institute, Antwerp, Tom Tosseyn made a switch to the Graphic Design Department at the Antwerp Royal Academy of Fine Arts, graduating in 1998. Three years later Tom became a laureate in art at the Higher Institute for Fine Arts in Antwerp (HISK).

During his study period Tom used to design already t-shirt graphics, logos, invitations etc. for a number of clothing stores, in the meantime claiming the streets of Antwerp with his guerilla art along with posters and flyers for the legendary doZer underground parties and events organised by 5voor12 (among others De Nachten, 10DAYSOFF, Night Cruiser, De Zomer van Antwerpen).

Tom’s career in fashion began in 2002, when he moved to Italy to join Diesel’s (55DSL) creative team.
Four years later he was recruited by Hugo Boss, Germany.

After six years of working abroad Tom returned to Belgium and since 2008 lives in Antwerp, still active as a freelance designer and consultant for several international clothing brands and high fashion labels.

In 2011, driven by his expanding interest in fashion, Tom independently designed and produced a limited edition of luxury silk foulards, followed by his T-shirt series and his famous weekender bag, what he considers just the beginning of a new venture.

Tom has picked up his artistic career in 2010 and since then participated in collaboration shows with Belgian and international artists at Z33 in Hasselt, Annette De Keyser gallery and MX7 gallery in Antwerp, Frans Masereel Centrum, …
